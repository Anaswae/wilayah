The current approach being taken is to fetch data from Kemdagri's (the Indonesian Interior Ministry) master reference and build an ontology model based on that. There will also be mappings to other ontologies, such as GeoNames, schema.org, etc.\r\n\r\nYou can find the current ontology in Turtle format at <http://benangmerah.github.io/idn-adm-div-ont/ontology.ttl>.\r\n\r\n### About BenangMerah\r\nBenangMerah is a project to connect information on social development in Indonesia into a knowledge base using Semantic Web technologies.\r\n\r\nBenangMerah is developed by Andhika Nugraha, a student at Institut Teknologi Bandung.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
